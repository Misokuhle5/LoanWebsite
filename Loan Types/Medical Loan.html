    <h1>Medical loan</h1>

    <p>Crimson Cash Loans medical loan is more like a personal loan taken out for the<br>
       specific purpose of financing medical treatment. Medical loans can pay for<br>
       a variety of medical costs, like elective surgeries, IVF treatment and emergency<br>
       procedures. Most on our medical loans are unsecured, so you don't have<br>
       to put your home or another asset as collateral in the name of your health.<br>
       However, to get our lowest rates, you'll need good credit. If your credit score<br>
       needs work. If you've struggled to pay medical bills in the past Crimson Cash Loans <br>
       can also offer secured medical loan just for you. <br>
       The trade-off is that you'll need to offer some form of collateral, which you'll <br>
       lose if you cannot pay the loan. But you'll get a much lower interest rate <br>
       and will have less to pay off in the future.</p>


       <h2>How does a Medical loan work?</h2>

    <p>You can get a medical loan at Crimson Cash Loans just by applying online or at <br>
       our Offices. Crimson Cash Loans will also let you get prequalified, a process that<br>
       shows you realistic offers without hurting your credit. To officially apply<br>
       for the loan with Crimson Cash Loans, a credit check, salary verification and<br>
       other information will be required. The timeline for receiving the funds after<br>
       approval will vary from Crimson Cash loans to you but can take as long as a week<br>
       in some instances. Once you receive funds, you'll make fixed monthly payments until<br>
       the loan is paid back in full, with interest added to each payment.</p>


   <h2>Medical Loan For Medical Dept Consolidation</h2>

    <p>Crimson Cash Loans offers medical loan for medical dept consolidation with the<br>
       rates from 15% - 25%. When applying for medical consolidation loan we do<br>

       to your credit score. Crimson Cash loans offers a minimum of 500 credit<br>
       and up to a maximum of 50000 on Medical dept consolidation.</p>

    <h2>What is the payment method of Medical loan?</h2>

       Rate offer for the first year might charge interest retroactively if the full balance isn't<br>
       paid off before the 12 months are up. After the 12 months our interest rates are from<br>
       15% - 25% depending on negotiations. If you're considering a medical credit card as <br>
