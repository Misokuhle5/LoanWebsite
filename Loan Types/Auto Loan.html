    <h1>Auto loan</h1>


    <h2>What is an Auto loan?</h2>

    <p>An auto loan allows someone to borrow money to purchase a car or truck. Auto <br>
       loans are usually simple-interest loans that are to be paid back over a period of<br>
       typically three or five years. A car is often the second-largest purchase someone<br>
       will make aside from their home. Auto loans help make vehicles that often-cost <br>
       eighty of thousands of Rands more affordable by breaking up the high cost into <br>
       monthly payments that work with different borrower's budgets.<br>



    <h2>How do Auto loan work?</h2>

    <p>Our Auto loans are simple-interest loans, where the Crimson Cash Loans <br>
       expects to be repaid by the borrower in monthly instalments for the amount we <br>
       lent (the principal), plus interest (the cost of borrowing from Crimson Cash loans, <br>
       shown as a percentage of the principal balance). When buyers apply for an auto <br>
       loan through Crimson Cash Loans, we will assess your credit score, annual <br>
       income, job history and other factors that determine how likely you are to repay. <br>
       Generally, the higher your income and credit score is, the larger the loan amount <br>
       and the lower the interest rate you can expect to be offered by a Crimson Cash <br>
       Loans, respectively. Alternatively, you may also apply through a car dealer after <br>
       you've selected a car to buy. Typically, dealer auto loans come with higher <br>
       interest rates than Crimson Cash Loans rates. <br>



    <h2>What is the payment method of Auto loan?</h2>

    <p>Depending on your credit rating, annual income, and the size of the loan, you <br>
       may offer you auto loans with a wide range of time-related repayment terms. <br>
       Typically, a borrower is expected to pay back the Crimson Cash Loans in monthly <br>
       instalments over the course of one to five years (whatever the borrower and <br>
       Crimson Cash Loans agree upon). Our rate starts from 15% - 25%. With many <br>
       buyers purchasing more expensive vehicles these days, many Crimson Cash <br>
       Loans now offer auto loans with repayment terms of up to 80 months (7 years). <br>
       A longer repayment term may make your monthly payments smaller than they <br>
       would be under a shorter-term auto loan, but you would also have to pay more <br>
       in interest charges over the life of the loan as you would have to make more payments (with interest) overall.</p>
